#Epigrams in Programming

This is a list of my favorite epigrams from this site:

seek it everywhere

It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.

Everything should be built top-down, except the first time.

A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth
knowing.
