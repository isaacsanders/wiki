<h1 id="toc_1">CURRICULUM NEWSPAPER</h1>

<p>
I read internet newspapers all day and glean and cull some cool stories about
--- EVERYTHING.
</p>

<p>
It is a huge resource for ---- EVERYTHING.
</p>

<p>
 SHARE WITH YOUR BUDDIES.
</p>

<p>
MY HOME PAGE HAS LOTS ABOUT "science ed" – and my dinosaur digs in China,
Switzerland, and Montana (TRex discovery)
</p>

<p>
NEWSPAPERS are –
something everyone likes to read,
non-threatening,
have short articles,
6th grade reading level,
contain data for further research.
</p>

<p>
It is hard to think of 'the school curriculum' broken into 250 pieces (Files),
but this list of teacher resources is a huge 'newspaper' of events for the past
4 years.
</p>

<p>
Around 5th grade, pairs of kids could be 'assigned' a File – and report to the
class about the '2 coolest things they found.'
</p>

<p>
This 'newspaper' is all about developing teachers and children with a passion
for learning and who are curious about everything.
</p>

<p>
On my computer, this CURRICULUM NEWSPAPER changes every day.
</p>

<p>
If you are reading this in ... say ... August 2012, and want the "latest"
edition of any File – write me: <a href="mailto:mleyden@eiu.edu">mailto:mleyden@eiu.edu</a>
</p>

<p>
New 'Files' (categories) are constantly being added.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_1.1">HEAVY FILLOSOFEE</h2>

<p>
I would shock students by revealing the fact that THEY WILL NOT BE
TEACHERS.
</p>

<p>
A person spends about 8% of their life - teaching.
What do you do in the other 92% of your time on earth?
</p>

<p>
THAT is who 'you are' and you will take THAT persona into the
classroom.
</p>

<p>
If you are passionate about learning and curious about everything ... guess
what kind of classroom you will have.
</p>

<p>
I didn't:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
'hunt' dinosaurs in China &amp; Montana &amp; Switzerland

<li>
autopsy mummies in Chile, etc.

</ul>

<p>
to ‘be a better teacher.
</p>

<p>
I did those things because I was curious.
</p>

<p>
How did I get to be a teacher?
</p>

<p>
I didn’t plan to do any of those things.
</p>

<p>
I planned to be a boring person – but someone came along and destroyed that
dream.
</p>

<p>
He was called . . . a teacher.
</p>

<p>
A weird but inspiring story.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy this fabulous resource and share it with kids, plumbers, mailmen,
neighbors, aunts, nieces, etc.
</p>

<p>
Keep this – for eons. It will be of interest to 5th graders and those in their
5th year of graduate school.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy,
</p>

<p>
cheers,
</p>
